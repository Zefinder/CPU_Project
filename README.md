# CPU_Project
## Overall presentation of the project
This is a summer project where I have fun creating a CPU in VHDL using `Sigasi Studio` (that I can only recommend). This is to calm all this stress and frustration of the CPU project we had at school! So now I take pleasure to do it. If you want to participate, tell me!

## Organisation of the project
This project is, for now, only to make a 8-bits CPU without any pipeline levels. If I want to, I will implement pipelines, increase the data size, add a few more instructions, blablabla. This will only depend on how much I want to finish it. 

I will probably make a compiler, an interpreter and documentation of this CPU so it will be possible to use its assembly or to compile from C to this assembly for this CPU. Why not making an OS for this CPU hahaha

This CPU has a few components. The one that are ok are marked with (\/) currently developped are marked with (\*), the ones that are developped but where tests are lacking or are simply not implemented are marked with (+), the ones that still need to be developped are marked with (#) and finally the ones that will be improved are marked with ($).

- ALU				(\/)($) (Add memory read or memory write (needs to be discussed...))
- Register bank 	(\/)
- Flag bank			(\/)
- Branching unit	(\/)
- RAM memory		(\/) (Add offset multiplication [R0, R1, #2])
- Control unit      (\/)
- CPU as a whole    (\*)(+)

The ALU does not have all the instructions I wanted to have (rol ror asl, etc...) This can be possible if the ALU takes a register and number + register instead of the possibility of 2 numbers... This would add 16 additional operations, this will be a big boy ALU :D.

I is reaaaaaally hard to test the CPU unlike the other components... To do so, we prepare a few example programs that tries to test the most things possible. There will be 4 sets of tests:
- ALU set         (\/)
- Branch set      (#)
- Storing set     (#)
- Complete set    (#)

These tests ideally will be in assembly and compiled language (so it means that I need to do a basic compiler)... 

The further developpement I can see is to find an FPGA where you can plug a mass memory to store programs on and configure the FPGA to start on a specific address of the memory to run a specific program. This configuration will load the program into the CPU instruction memory and then launch it. It will make the CPU easier to use (not modifying the constant array each time! Efficiency go brrr). Hence the few other components I see to add:

- 16 bits or 32 bits registers !    (#)
- Interruption table                (#)
- Instruction memory             	(#)
- Instruction loader            	(#)
- Program chooser		            (#)

Maybe that only a CPU is a little sad, like you have the process unit ok but you don't have anything to interract with it. You will get the same result again and again... It's perfect for tests I agree, but still if we could add a little more things... 

- Change the RAM memory and instruction memory to a bus (16 bits?)		(#)
- Bus mapper															(#)
- Increase the RAM														(#) 

Yes this is perfect, so now you can map things to a bus, and so interract with them! You would be able to event connect a screen and create a little game (Possible with a 16 byte of RAM, look how much RAM they used for Super Mario Bros ha ha)? I guess that everything would be possible with a bus, the used would need to make the mapping and not me! And I leave them the creation of a PPU or a GPU :)

Or maybe make all registers the same size, I mean 16 bits is a lot and not hard to do but it takes a lot of space...

## Configuration of the IDE
I chose Sigasi Studio for my IDE since it's waaaaaaay better than Vivado or other tools that I've already tried. However it does not include a compiler nor a simulator nor anything to synthetise (or implement). It is possible to link one to Sigasi and this is the whole point of this paragraph (I'm organised!).

### Compiler and simulator setup
Sigasi have already options for loads of compilers and I chose **GHDL**, open source compiler written in ADA, which is available for both Windows and Linux. To setup GHDL for the compilation, go to **Window > Preferences** and then **Sigasi > Toolchains > GHDL**. Select the bin path of the GHDL directory and you will just have to launch the simulation from the Hierarchy View! *(Do not forget to set the correct unit as top level...)*.

I also configured a simulation folder (named `simulation`) where all vcd files go. Here is the line I used to configure it like that:

```
--vcd='${sigasi_toplevel:project_path}/simulation/${sigasi_toplevel:short}.vcd'
```

Click on the **Toolchains** item in the tree and select **GHDL**. Please apply before closing...

### Run setup
It can also be a good idea to have something to read the vcd files (to see the trace of signals throughout the simulation) and this can be directly configured within Sigasi Studio. If you have Linux this is easy, just enter the command you want, if you have Windows... get prepared. Go to **Run > External Tools > External tools configuration** and create a new run configuration. 

- For Windows
You will have work to do to succeed but a way to do it is to use the Linux virtual machine for Windows (WSL) (If I find an easier way I'll put it also)

In Windows Explorer, go to the `workspaceSigasi` directory, create a **batch** script (that I will call `simu.bat`) and put this (of course you can modify it...): 

```batch
@echo off
rem ENTER YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY NAME
set DIR_NAME=CPU_Project

rem ENTER YOUR BASH SCRIPT NAME (eg. simu.sh)
set SCRIPT_NAME=simu.sh

rem ENTER UNIX PATH TO WINDOWS
set UNIX_C=/mnt/c

rem TOUCH AND YOU ARE DEAD
set SCRIPT_PATH=%cd%
set SCRIPT_PATH=%SCRIPT_PATH:\=/%
set SCRIPT_PATH=%UNIX_C%%SCRIPT_PATH:~2%
bash -c "%SCRIPT_PATH%/%SCRIPT_NAME% \"%SCRIPT_PATH%/%DIR_NAME%/simulation/%1\""
```

Still in the same directory create a **bash** script (that I will call `simu.sh`). I will use gtk waves for it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "Launching wave simulation for $1"
gtkwave "$1"
```

**WARNING** it can say that there is an error at line 1 with something like `#!/usr/bin/bash^M`. It's becase Unix does not use the same new lines, so in that case use Notepad++ to convert the file in Unix style: **Edit > EOL Conversion > Unix (LF)**.

Return in the external tool configuration and in the **location** field you can put the full path to your **batch** script, in the **workspace location** field put the path to your `workspaceSigasi` and as argument put `${selected_resource_name}`.

- Linux

You can directly launch gtk waves or create a script if you want to do something else before (like deleting the file). Just be careful, `${selected_resource_name}` only give the file name (eg. `ram_memory_test.vcd`), not the full path! Try things I don't know, I'm a Windows user!

### Troubleshooting
- There is an error with gtkwaves
I'm 100% sure you forgot to install gtkwaves, try to install it.

- There is an error where it can't find the simulation folder when launching simulation
Have you tried to create a `simulation` folder? 

- I have the following error:
```
Unable to resource a selected resource:
${selected_resource_name}
```

The `${selected_resource_name}` variable takes the name of the selected resource of the `Project Explorer` tree. Select a file and then you will be able to launch it! This deselection can happen when you delete a file or when you closed the `Project Explorer` tree view.

- I have an error when I launch a file, gtk says : `Why: No such file or directory` but the file exist!

Make sure you selected a file in the simulation directory and that this file is a `.vcd` file. Else it will search for your file in the `simulation` directory and not find it (normal!).

- My .vcd file is going bigger and bigger and bigger, what the hell????

VHDL is a great language and the simulation works well... maybe too well. I am not here to make a VHDL class, however you might not have:
- A `wait` statement in all your processes
- Stopped your simulation when you want to if it's made on purpose.

Here is an example of a test that **will never stop**:

```vhdl
memory_test_process : process is
begin
    a <= x"00";
    wait for 5 ns;
    a <= x"10";
    
    wait;
end process memory_test_process;

clk_timing : process is
    variable counter : natural := 0;

begin
    clk     <= not clk;
    wait for 5 ns;
end process clk_timing;
```

Here is an example of a test that **will stop**:

```vhdl
memory_test_process : process is
begin
    a <= x"00";
    wait for 5 ns;
    a <= x"10";
    
    wait;
end process memory_test_process;

clk_timing : process is
    variable counter : natural := 0;

begin
    clk     <= not clk;
    counter := counter + 1;
    wait for 5 ns;

    if counter = 10 then -- This will happen someday!
        wait;
    end if;

end process clk_timing;
```

This goes to 1GB really fast, be carefull to not forget to stop the simulation!

## CPU capabilities
Of course, I won't make a CPU without exposing what you can do with it. As I still continue to develop it, this paragraph can be updated and is, for now, only the global idea of the final looking of this CPU. If I have other ideas I will put them here.

### Components of an instruction
An instruction is divided in 4 parts : 
- Opcode (1 byte)
- A/First operand (register size bytes (for now 1))
- B/Second operand (register size bytes (for now 1))
- Address (RAM address size bytes)

There are a few things to know to fully understand how to write assembly for this CPU: 
- The opcode allows a lot of instruction and thus have a lot of options (see *Instruction opcode meaning*, *Addressing mode* and *Instruction map*)
- A and B are basically the input of the ALU as well as the size of a register. Changing ones size implies also changing the other to have the whole structure working.
- The address is the size of the RAM address and *only for now* twice the size of the register selector. This will change but be sure to verify the following assumption: `size_address >= 2 * size_register_selector`.
- Register address for writing is always the least significant bits in the address part. For a **8-bits address** and **4-bits selector**, it will be `XXXXAAAA` (A being address and X ignored).
- Register address for reading is the least significant bits of the A or B operand (for respectively the first and second register). 
- The **LR** and **PC** registers are special, they will be (because not yet implemented) the size of an address. They are located at address `0xE` and `0xF`, if the normal register output is too small, they will be truncated.

### Instruction opcode meaning
Each bit in the opcode means something for the operation. Changing the opcode can lead to a complete other operation (like from `MOV` *(0b01000000)* to `BEQ` *(0b01000010)* changing the bit 1) or to another addressing mode (like for `MOV` *0b01000000* and *0b01100000*). For more details about all instructions possible, see *Instruction map*. For more details about addressing modes, see *Addressing mode* (it's all pretty logic).

All opcode specifications are detailed in the table and explanations below:
|           |   ALU operations   |     | Branch operation |     | Store operation |
| :-------: | :----------------: | --- | :--------------: | --- | :-------------: |
| **Bit 7** |       UNUSED       |     |    FLAG_SEL_1    |     |     STR_MEM     |
| **Bit 6** |     ALU_SEL_3      |     |    FLAG_SEL_0    |     |     STR_REG     |
| **Bit 5** | UNUSED (ALU_SEL_4) |     |  USE_REG_OFFSET  |     |     USE_MEM     |
| **Bit 4** |     USE_REG_1      |     |   USE_REG_ADDR   |     |   MEM_OFFSET    |
| **Bit 3** |     EN_ALU (1)     |     |    EN_ALU (0)    |     |   EN_ALU (0)    |
| **Bit 2** |     ALU_SEL_2      |     |     INV_FLAG     |     |     UNUSED      |
| **Bit 1** |     ALU_SEL_1      |     |  EN_BRANCH (1)   |     |  EN_BRANCH (0)  |
| **Bit 0** |     ALU_SEL_0      |     |  EN_REL_BRANCH   |     |     USE_REG     |

Bit names have pretty self-explanatory names but it's always good to be sure of what you are dealing with. Note that this is a little explanation, for a complete one please read the pdf that will arrive maybe someday or read the code!
- ALU_SEL: Selector of the ALU - 4 bits so 16 operations, 7 calculations operations and 9 flag manipulation operations
- EN_ALU: Enables the ALU
- USE_REG_1: Uses the first register as input of the ALU
- FLAG_SEL: Selector for flag bank - 2 bits so 4 flags (in order Carry (C), Zero (Z), Negative (N), Overflow (V))
- EN_BRANCH: Enables the branching unit
- USE_REG_ADDR: Uses register as address for branching (can used to branch using `PC`)
- USE_REG_OFFSET: Uses a register as offset for branching
- EN_REL_BRANCH: Enables relative branching
- INV_FLAG: Inverts the flag check condition, branch if flag not set
- STR_MEM: Stores in memory
- STR_REG: Stores in register
- USE_MEM: Uses memory as register load
- MEM_OFFSET: Uses register as offset for memory address
- USE_REG: Uses register as register input

Yet another little remark: note that for a same category, if it can use two times a register it won't be necessarily the same! For example the ALU can use 2 registers, it is totally possible to do like `ADD R2 R0 R1`. Same thing for branching: `BCC ~R1` is the same thing as `BCC PC R1` and will branch if carry clear to `PC + R1`.

**TODO CHANGE MOV BIT FOR REGISTER**

### Instruction map
This map does not contain any information about addressing mode, for this refer to the *addressing mode* section (or the future not yet written pdf).

All opcodes marked with \* are opcodes that are not used with their defined opcode (they are here since there are unused bits).

All opcodes marked with \*\* are unofficial opcodes. They are opcodes that uses a combination of existing functionnality to do something that was not meant for because of clock cycles configuration. Most of them must be followed by a `NOP`s to be working normally. They exist because of the conception of the CPU allows it. 

If you think that we are missing of ALU operations, I totally agree! We could at least these few ones `ASL`, `ASR`, `LSL`, `LSR`, `ROR`, `ROL`

There will be a STR and LDR with shift but this is WIP, I still need to process how I'll do that... 

### Addressing modes

As this CPU is a really well made CPU (isn't it :D), an operation can have multiple *addressing modes*. What is an addressing mode? It is a different opcode that indicates the CPU that the operation is the same but that the operands don't mean the same thing... This is unclear? Let's make an example!

If we take the instruction `0x0805A501`, this will be interpreted by the CPU as `ADD R0 $05 $A5`. But what if I wanted to say that it was `ADD R0 R5 $A5`? You need another opcode of the same operation. It's the addressing mode! (By the way, the instruction would be `0x1805A501`)

Here is a list of all addressing modes that are available for this instruction set with the targetted operations and an assembly example:
|    Addressing mode    | Concerned opcodes                           | Example             |
| :-------------------: | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------ |
|       Immediate       | SEC, SEZ, SEN, SEV, CLC, CLZ, CLN, CLV, NOP | SEC                 |
|    First constant     | ADD, SUB, MUL, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, CMP, MOV  | AND R0 $A0 R2       |
|    First register     | ADD, SUB, MUL, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, CMP, MOV  | AND R0 R1 R3        |
|  Absolute address\*   | BCS, BEQ, BMI, BVS, BCC, BNE, BPL, BVC      | BCS $F0             |
|   Relative offset\*   | BCS, BEQ, BMI, BVS, BCC, BNE, BPL, BVC      | BCS ~$F0            |
|  Relative address\*   | BCS, BEQ, BMI, BVS, BCC, BNE, BPL, BVC      | BCS PC ~$F0         |
|    Direct constant    | MOV                                         | MOV R0 #10          |
|    Direct register    | MOV                                         | MOV R0 R1           |
|    Absolute memory    | STR, LDR                                    | STR R0 [R1]         |
|    Relative memory    | STR, LDR                                    | STR R0 [R1, R0]     |
| Relative shift memory | STR, LDR                                    | STR R0 [R1, R0, #2] |

All addressing modes marked with \* can be either with registers or with values. For example, `BCS PC ~$F0`, `BCS $00 ~$F0`, `BCS PC ~R0`, `BCS PC ~R0` are all possible! 

## How to create a test and a test set

Just a note like that, don't forget to change the `TEST_FILES_DIRECTORY` constant...

### How to create a test
The system is made to try to be the simplest possible (it's still quite hard...). But first you need to understand how the CPU works and how tests are designed.

The CPU has one output designed for testing. This output is the output of the ALU. This is the easiest thing to find since you don't have addresses to mess with! A test is a compiled file with a *.txt* file. The compiled file contains the code, the txt file contains the expected results of the execution. To test a value, use `CMP` and put the expected result in the *.txt* file. 

**IMPORTANT**: There are a few thing that must be respected:
- Compiled and *.txt* files **MUST** have the name of the test set directory followed by `_n`, where `n` is the test number
- The compiled file **MUST** be compiled and not only an assembly code file
- The test count for the corresponding set must be updated

For instance:

- Content of test assembly `alu_set_1.s` (not yet compiled, after compilation: `alu_set_1`)
```assembly
; Simple addition
MOV R0 $A0
ADD R1 R0 $0A
CMP R1 ; Outputs the value of R1
```

- Content of the *.txt* `alu_set_1.txt`
```
AA
```

### How to create a test set
Create a new directory in the `assembly_test_set` directory. In the `cpu_test.vhd` file, add two new constants (next to the others for example):
- The set name (name of the new directory) as a string
- The test count as a natural

```vhdl
constant NEW_SET_NAME : string := "new_set";
constant NEW_SET_TEST_COUNT : natural := 5;
```

In the `cpu_test_process` process, create a new variable (also next to the others for example) and add it to the set array:

```vhdl
variable new_set  : test_set := (new string'(NEW_SET_NAME), NEW_SET_TEST_COUNT);
variable test_files_array : test_files_array_t(0 to x) := (..., new_set); -- x is the number - 1 in the array 
```

To add tests, please refer to the previous subsubsection. I will try to make a txt file in the future so the vhdl test file remains untouched!

## How can I code with this ASM
Do you have problems? You should go to the doctor because it's scary... There is syntax highlighting for **Notepad++** and **(Neo)Vim**. The instructions are in the READMEs in their respective folders in `syntax` (Yes there are too many nested folders, don't judge me). Don't expect more for now... (Joking, I'll probably do something for vscode (hi hi hi no) (unless...))

## How can I compile the ASM?
A good question! I am currently doing a compiler with flex/yacc to parse and compile at the same time. If you want to see how it works, look in the `compiler` folder, there is everything I used to make the lexical analysis (flex), the grammar (yacc) and the compilation (bison). 

**THIS IS FOR LINUX ONLY I AM AFRAID...**

**Note** that there will be more than one version and I am still developping the first one... Here is what will be expected:
| Version number | Content                                                                                      |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       1        | Lexical analysis, grammatical analysis, parsing all official instructions, compilation (WIP) |
|       2        | Label analysis, label symbol table, jump on label                                            |
|       3        | Unofficial opcode support (Will probably never happen :D)                                    |

*I should maybe make a tutorial repo for flex/yacc...*

I still need to make tests for the compilation but it should be ok I think...

## How can I run what I coded?
I didn't have finished yet the CPU and I haven't started a compiler yet. And you want me to run compiled code? When the CPU will be finished (or when I will want to make a small break), I will make an interpreter one day. But for now nothing is planned...

## Why a CPU?
Why not?

## Are you crazy to do VHDL???
I think so, but it's not a problem right?
